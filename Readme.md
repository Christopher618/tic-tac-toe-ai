# Tic Tac Toe AI
#### A playable Tic Tac Toe game implemented with Python using the Minimax algorithm for an unbeatable AI. GUI built with Tkinter.

Growing up, I liked playing board games. Whether it was in school, during slow moments in class or with my sister when we were alone, there was never a bad time. But one game stood out. A game so entertaining yet with simple rules that could be played even on a piece of paper. Tic-Tac-Toe was the most convenient board game to play in any situation.

After four months of working with Python, I finally felt ready to put my skill and understanding to the test. I decided to build a Tic-Tac-Toe game using the Minimax algorithm to make it unbeatable. Fresh from the first week of Harvard CS50 AI course, I based the project's logic on the template introduced in the class.

To start, I needed eight core functions which would contain the game's logic. Each of them would have a role such as creating the board, detecting empty cells, setting winning conditions and more. Unsurprisingly, the Mininmax function was the most challenging to implement. But after many debugging sessions, my game's brain was finally good to go.

Afterwards, I set out to implement the game's GUI with the Tkinter module. Using it for the first time, I honestly thought I would have a lot to learn before being comfortable enough to add it on a project. However, it clicked quickly fast and after a day of experimenting and learning, I started building the interface.

To build a 3x3 board, I used button widget. To make the cell interactive, I needed two function which would handle the player's click and the AI's turn. After implementing them and checking if my logic was correctly linked with the GUI, the Tic-Tac-Toe game was finally playable. Furthermore, I added a replay button, letting the player have more control over the game.

Building this game had made me realize that I was capable of following a project from start to finish. It also helped validate where I stood as a Python developer. I've learned many different skills and gained valuable experience. Even though the game is fully functional, I believe there's still many other features I could add, for instance a start over button, alternate game modes and more. But as for now, I'm really proud of what I've made so far and I'm eager to see what I'll build next.
